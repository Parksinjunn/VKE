Past Updates
----------------------------------------------------
This is the first update in the progress towards porting from 1.3 to 1.4. A LOT is disabled and currently I'd say about only half of the mod is here, but almost all the weapons are here and functional. 
Everything should be pretty much the same except for these two changes:
- Addition of the Delta, Psi, and Theta Knives
- Changes to the visuals of Daedalus Stormblades
